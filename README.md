# ⚡ Low-Level Enthusiast | Android Kernel Dev

> If I can't audit the source, I don't run the binary.

I am a self-taught developer dedicated to hardware sovereignty. I don't believe in "stock" experiences—I daily-drive my own custom kernels to ensure my hardware actually belongs to me.

### 🛠️ The Workbench
* **Kernel Development:** Writing and optimizing in **C** for Android systems.
* **Environment:** Built from the ground up in **Neovim** using a custom **Lua** configuration.
* **Mobile First:** Developing, compiling, and deploying directly from **Termux**.

### 🔭 Currently Working On
* 📱 Optimizing [Geek / Qualcomn Snapdragon 675] for peak performance and minimal overhead.
* 🔧 Refining my Neovim Lua modules for a faster C-development workflow.
* 🧬 Deep-diving into memory management and scheduler tunables.

### 💬 Let's Talk About
* Why **C** is still king for systems programming.
* The nuances of building for ARM/ARM64 architectures.
* Why your stock kernel is holding your hardware back.
