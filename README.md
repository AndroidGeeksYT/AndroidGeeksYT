# ⚡ Low-Level Enthusiast | Android Kernel Dev

> If I can't audit the source, I don't run the binary.

I am a self-taught developer dedicated to hardware sovereignty. I don't believe in "stock" experiences—I daily-drive my own custom kernels to ensure my hardware actually belongs to me.

### 🛠️ The Workbench

- **Kernel Development:** Writing and optimizing in **C** for Android systems.
- **Environment:** Built from the ground up in **Neovim** using a custom **Lua** configuration.
- **Mobile First:** Developing, compiling, and deploying directly from **Termux**.

### 🔭 Currently Working On

- 📱 Optimizing [ geek kernel / Qualcomn Snapdragon 675 ] for peak performance and minimal overhead.
- 🔧 Refining my Neovim Lua modules for a faster C-development workflow.
- 🔧 Refining my Dotfiles for having a nice / cool development workflow.
- 🧬 Deep-diving into memory management and scheduler tunables.

### 💬 Let's Talk About

- Why **C** is still king for systems programming.
- The nuances of building for ARM/ARM64 architectures.
- Why your stock kernel is holding your hardware back.
